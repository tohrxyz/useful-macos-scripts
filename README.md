# Useful macos scripts
a collection of useful macos scripts for use.

### movToMp4.sh
- should be ran inside a folder where you have *.mov files
- requires ffmpeg
- what it does:
  1.  searches for newest *.mov file inside the folder
  2.  converts it to mp4 via ffmpeg
  3.  deletes the original one
  4.  opens and highlights it inside the finder
#### why ?
native default screen recorder on macos saves videos in mov format and some apps can't work with it. also files are larger in size.
